    <!--
        My plan is to make the map constantly up and make it the contentArea. The navList* would then be on top of this for a graphical effect, padding/margins will
        allow the map to be visible around it slightly. Data areas will then be added to the screen in a smaller window/div (need to look into)** that contains the datam.
        Clicking another data link will just replace the contents of the current data window with that of the new datam, might do something to compare datam when
        clicking on an enemy and bringing up their information. This window will be closable via clicking an X or the like. Likewise, clicking the "Back to Map" link
        will close any window open, could possibly make it reload the map depending on later build mechanics, especially visually with structures and other dynamic
        changes. The footer will also likely be an overlay in that it may be shrunk in width and have some transparency.
        Pros:
            This will pretty much solve the reload issue, where being on a data page and pressing reload would bring you to map - we'll see when it's done, but this
                will most likely have a similar effect by closing any data windows but may not and this won't be a terrible side-effect.
            This should create a more appealing display utilizing the majority of the page and avoiding any possibility of a scrollbar except possibily in data windows
                which may actually make the windows look better but will see.
            Might make popup information (clicking on enemy land and displaying brief details) more easy to implement
        Cons:
            Less space to display datam which may result in the use of scrollbars.
            We'll have to redesign a decent amount of the layout and construction.

        *May make navList a drop down menu to minimize its effect on the visual area, bringing spotlight to the map alone
