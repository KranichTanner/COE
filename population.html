Population Data
<ul>
    <li>
        Total pop count of all lands
    </li>
    <li>
        Pop count of current land and a percent matching how much that represents of the total pop
    </li>
    <li>
        Happiness in current land
    </li>
    <li>
        Form of distributing jobs (farmers, builders, etc.) - Maybe through sliders and manual entry through text fields
        <ul>
            <li>
                Could also display stats about jobs (happiness value granted, money made, money lost, etc.) and proportions of people in certain jobs
            </li>
            <li>
                Also demographic data would be good here - Pop poor/rich, pop homeless, pop happiness distribution, ethnicity, maybe age stats
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Way to host happiness boosters or events for pop - Could declare certain days holidays (making it global or local to current land), host festivals, set up offers for pop (Free hats at town hall or something)
    </li>
</ul>
