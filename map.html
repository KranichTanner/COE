<!--IMPORTANT NOTE: Must set canvas dimensions here in attributes or in javascript (set in js) so that bitmap size is correct and canvas is painted accordingly. CSS only effects visual size, not bitmap-->
<canvas id="canvasMap">Canvas element does not work on this current browser or browser version.</canvas>
<script>mapClick()</script> <!--This will repaint and resize the canvas though I'm not sure why the canvas otherwise shrinks if map is clicked on since other components remain their normal size.-->
